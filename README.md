# My Version of arxiv-style

This is my version of the [arxiv-style](https://github.com/kourgeorge/arxiv-style) LaTeX template.

## Changes

- **Google Scholar Icon Macro**: Added a macro that generates a Google Scholar icon next to the author's name, which links to the author's Google Scholar profile (similar to ORCID icons).
- **Acknowledgments Section Macro**: Added a macro for the acknowledgments section for easier formatting.

### Future Improvements

I may continue to enhance this template in the future.
